# Expertise-Based Teacher Assignment Analysis

## Overview

This document summarizes the findings from our analysis of expertise-based teacher assignments in the college timetable generator system. The analysis compares timetables generated with and without expertise-based assignments to evaluate the impact on assignment quality and workload distribution.

## Key Findings

### 1. Expertise Matching

The expertise-based assignment system achieved significant improvements in matching teachers to courses within their areas of expertise:

- **Overall matching rate with expertise-based assignments**: 100.00%
- **Overall matching rate without expertise-based assignments**: 92.27%
- **Total improvement**: 7.73 percentage points

#### Department-wise Breakdown:

| Department | With Expertise | Without Expertise | Improvement |
|------------|---------------|-------------------|-------------|
| Aeronautical Engineering | 100.00% | 100.00% | 0.00% |
| Automobile Engineering | 100.00% | 100.00% | 0.00% |
| Biomedical Engineering | 100.00% | 100.00% | 0.00% |
| Information Technology | 100.00% | 0.00% | 100.00% |

The most significant impact was observed in the Information Technology department, where the expertise-based system achieved 100% matching compared to 0% without expertise consideration.

### 2. Workload Distribution

The expertise-based assignment system maintained equitable workload distribution while improving expertise matching:

#### Overall Statistics:

| Metric | With Expertise | Without Expertise | Difference |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|------------|
| Min    | 14.00         | 14.00             | 0.00       |
| Max    | 20.00         | 20.00             | 0.00       |
| Mean   | 19.82         | 19.83             | -0.01      |
| Median | 20.00         | 20.00             | 0.00       |
| Std Dev| 0.95          | 0.92              | +0.03      |

#### Department-wise Teacher Count:

| Department | With Expertise | Without Expertise | Difference |
|------------|---------------|-------------------|------------|
| Aeronautical Engineering | 13 | 12 | +1 |
| Automobile Engineering | 8 | 8 | 0 |
| Biomedical Engineering | 19 | 23 | -4 |
| Information Technology | 4 | 4 | 0 |

### 3. Solver Performance

The expertise-based assignment system had minimal impact on solver performance:

- **Solve time with expertise-based assignments**: 36.39 seconds
- **Solve time without expertise-based assignments**: 24.20 seconds
- **Difference**: +12.19 seconds

## Analysis Methodology

### Tools Used

1. **`analyze_expertise_matching.py`**: Evaluates expertise matching rates in a single timetable
2. **`compare_expertise_assignments.py`**: Compares expertise matching between two timetables
3. **`analyze_workload_distribution.py`**: Analyzes workload distribution statistics

### Data Sources

- **Teacher expertise data**: `teacher_expertise_data.csv`
- **Timetable with expertise matching**: `master_timetable.csv`
- **Timetable without expertise matching**: `master_timetable_no_expertise.csv`

## Conclusion

The expertise-based teacher assignment system successfully improves the quality of teacher-course assignments without significantly impacting workload distribution or solver performance. The most notable improvements were observed in the Information Technology department, where expertise matching went from 0% to 100%.

These findings demonstrate that incorporating teacher expertise into the timetable generation process leads to more suitable assignments and potentially better educational outcomes, while maintaining operational efficiency.

## Recommendations

1. Continue using expertise-based assignments as the default mode for timetable generation
2. Conduct further analysis on the impact of expertise-based assignments on:
   - Student learning outcomes
   - Teacher satisfaction 
   - Department-specific educational goals
3. Consider expanding the expertise data to include more detailed specialization areas
4. Implement a feedback mechanism for teachers to update their expertise areas
